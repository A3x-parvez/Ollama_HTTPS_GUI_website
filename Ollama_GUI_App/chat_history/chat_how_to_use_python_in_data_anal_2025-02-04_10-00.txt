1. Install Anaconda â€“ It is the most popular distribution of Python and comes with packages like NumPy (for numerical computations), Pandas (data processing library), Matplotlib/Seaborn(visualization libraries) which are essential tools in python for Data Analysis 
2. Set up your coding environment - Most people prefer using Jupyter Notebooks or IDE such as PyCharm, Spyder etc to code and run the Python scripts on data analysis tasks because they allow you to mix text with executable codes easily like Markdown & LaTeX notations that help in taking notes/documenting.
3. Understand libraries - Learn how NumPy (for array processing), Pandas(data frames, handling of missing values etc) and Matplotlib or Seaborn for visualizations work as they are essential tools required to do data analysis with Python efficiently 
4. Get hands-on â€“ Start working on small datasets like Titanic dataset which is widely used in online courses/tutorials . Practice tasks such as importing, filtering & slicing of these columns , getting descriptive statistics (mean median mode etc), visualizing the distribution using histogram or box plots and doing inferential analysis by estimating confidence interval for a given parameter.
5. Learn data cleaning â€“ Data is never perfect in real world hence learn how to handle missing values, outliers & inconsistencts like standardization/normalization , dealing with duplicates etc which are essential aspects of any data preparation step before doing inferential analysis or building predictive models 
6. Start learning statistical inference - Learn about hypothesis testing (t-test, chi square test) and how to perform ANOVA(Analysis Of Variance), regression analyses including simple linear , multiple regressions etc . These are the techniques used in Python libraries such as SciPy & StatsModels which can be learned by taking online courses on Coursera or edX.com
7. Explore Predictive Modeling â€“ Learn about different types of models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees , Random Forest and SVM for classification tasks; Linear regression, Ridge/Lasso regularized regressions & Neural networks for continuous outcomes . These can be learned through online courses on platforms such as Coursera or Kaggle.
8. Finally understand Machine Learning algorithms - Algorithms like kNN(K-Nearest neighbor), DBSCAN (Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) , Hierarchical clustering etc used in scikit learn library and apply them to solve problems related to unsupervised learning tasks.
9. Continuously keep practicing â€“ Join Kaggle competitions, work on real world datasets available online or try out your skills at hackathons . Itâ€™s essential for improving coding style & algorithmic thinking 
10. Networking - Connect with other data science enthusiasts and professionals to learn more about the industry trends , latest research papers etc through platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter etc which can help in expanding knowledge horizon beyond just textbooks or online courses .
