```python
def add_two_numbers():
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

    total = num1 + num2
    print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {total}")

add_two_numbers()
```

In this code:

- The function `add_two_numbers()` asks for two numbers using the `input()` function.
- These numbers are converted to floats using the `float()` function, because if you simply use the `input()` function with numbers, they will be returned as strings and won't add up correctly.
- Then the sum of these two numbers is calculated by adding them together.
- The result is printed out.

Please note that this code does not include any error checking to make sure the user enters valid input. If you want to do that, you could use a `try/except` block or check if the numbers are numeric before trying to add them together:

```python
def add_two_numbers():
    while True:
        try:
            num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
            num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

            total = num1 + num2
            print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {total}")

            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Please enter a valid number.")

add_two_numbers()
```

This version of the function will keep asking for numbers until it gets two valid inputs.
