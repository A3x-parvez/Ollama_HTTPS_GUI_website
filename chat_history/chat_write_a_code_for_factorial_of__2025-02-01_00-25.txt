This implementation uses recursion:

```python
def fact(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1: # Base case when n is either 0 or self-reports as being one.
        return 1
    else:
        result = n * fact(n-1) # Recursive call to calculate the factorial of (n - 1).
        return result

# Testing the function with some values for `n`
print(fact(5)) # Outputs: 120, as expected because the mathematical expression is calculated like this: 5*4*3*2*1 = 120.
```
