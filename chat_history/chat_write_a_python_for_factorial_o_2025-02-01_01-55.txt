**Approach**

The factorial of a non-negative integer `n`, denoted by `n!`, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. In other words, it's the result of multiplying all positive integers from 1 up to `n`.

To calculate the factorial, we can use a simple iterative approach. Here are the steps:

1. Initialize a variable `result` to 1, which will store the final product.
2. Iterate from 1 to `n`, and in each iteration:
   - Multiply `result` by the current number (starting from 1).
3. Return the final value of `result`, which is the factorial of `n`.

**Step-by-Step Guide**

Let's take the example of calculating the factorial of 5:

```
1. Initialize result = 1
2. Iterate from 1 to 5:
   - Multiply result by 1: 1 * result = 1
   - Multiply result by 2: 1 * 2 = 2
   - Multiply result by 3: 2 * 3 = 6
   - Multiply result by 4: 6 * 4 = 24
   - Multiply result by 5: 24 * 5 = 120
3. Return the final value of result, which is 120
```

**Python Code**
```python
def factorial(n):
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer n.

    Args:
        n (int): A non-negative integer.

    Returns:
        int: The factorial of n.
    """

    # Base case: If n is 0 or 1, return 1
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1

    # Initialize result to 1
    result = 1

    # Iterate from 2 to n (inclusive)
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        # Multiply result by the current number
        result *= i

    # Return the final value of result
    return result


# Test the function with a sample input
n = 5
print(f"The factorial of {n} is: {factorial(n)}")
```

This code defines a function `factorial` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns its factorial. The function uses a simple iterative approach to calculate the factorial, starting from the base case where `n` is 0 or 1. In each iteration, it multiplies the current result by the next number in the sequence (starting from 2). Finally, it returns the final value of the result.

You can test this function with a sample input, such as `n = 5`, to see how it calculates and prints the factorial of 5.<br></body></html>
