**Approach**

The factorial of a number `n`, denoted by `n!`, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. For example, `5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`.

Here's how we can approach calculating the factorial in Java:

*   We will create a method that takes an integer as input and returns its factorial.
*   To calculate the factorial, we will use a loop that multiplies all the numbers from `n` down to 1.

**Code**

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = 5; // input number
        System.out.println("Factorial of " + num + " is: " + factorial(num));
    }

    /**
     * Calculate the factorial of a given number.
     *
     * @param n The input number.
     * @return The factorial of the input number.
     */
    public static long factorial(int n) {
        if (n < 0) {
            System.out.println("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.");
            return -1;
        } else if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
            // Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1.
            return 1;
        } else {
            long result = 1; // Initialize the product.
            for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) { // Loop from 2 to n (inclusive).
                result *= i; // Multiply the current number with the product.
            }
            return result; // Return the final product.
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation**

1.  We define a method `factorial` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns its factorial.
2.  If the input number is negative, we print an error message and return -1 to indicate that factorial is not defined for negative numbers.
3.  If the input number is 0 or 1, we simply return 1 since the factorial of these numbers is 1.

4.  For larger inputs (2 or more), we use a loop to multiply all numbers from `n` down to 1.

5.  We initialize a variable `result` to store the product and start the multiplication from 2 to `n`. In each iteration, we multiply the current number with the product using the expression `result *= i`.

6.  Once the loop finishes, we return the final product of all numbers multiplied together.

7.  In the `main` method, we test the `factorial` method by calling it with an input number and printing the result.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the input number, making it efficient for calculating factorials of large numbers.<br></body></html>
